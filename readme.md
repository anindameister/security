5. unix commands

- pwd : (present working directory) to see what your home directory is 

![pwd](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/3.PNG)

- ls : List the contents of your home directory by using the ls (list) command:

![ls](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/4.PNG)

- we started with a folder which had another folder named security, so basically the smart enough unix system ignores the empty part
- point to be noted, that the hiden git folder is not showed up

- ls –a
- the above even lists the hidden files and in our case it is git folder

![ls -a](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/5.PNG)

- ls –al: Get a bigger picture of the contents of the current directory (such as owner and size) by also using the -l (long) option 

![ls -al](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/6.PNG)

![ls -l](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/7.PNG)

- ls -al: shows the bigger picture including that of the hidden files
- ls -l: shows the bigger picture EXCLUDING that of the hidden files
- ll: shows the bigger picture EXCLUDING that of the hidden files and it is the shorter version of ls -l
