5. unix commands

- pwd : (present working directory) to see what your home directory is 

![pwd](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/3.PNG)

- ls : List the contents of your home directory by using the ls (list) command:

![ls](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/4.PNG)

- we started with a folder which had another folder named security, so basically the smart enough unix system ignores the empty part
- point to be noted, that the hiden git folder is not showed up

- ls –a
- the above even lists the hidden files and in our case it is git folder

![ls -a](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/5.PNG)

- ls –al: Get a bigger picture of the contents of the current directory (such as owner and size) by also using the -l (long) option 

![ls -al](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/6.PNG)

![ls -l](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/7.PNG)

- ls -al: shows the bigger picture including that of the hidden files
- ls -l: shows the bigger picture EXCLUDING that of the hidden files
- ll: shows the bigger picture EXCLUDING that of the hidden files and it is the shorter version of ls -l

- ls recording/ 
1. now this shows the contents of the recording folder
2. please note that while we did an ls to check the contents of the directory, recording/ came up and that's how I got to know that "recording/" is the one we got to get into
3. let's take a moment to check the hassle below

![ls -l](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/8.PNG)

4. windows: dir == linux: ls; windows: cd == linux: cd; windows:cd.. ==linux cd ..(note the space)

- mkdir folderName=linux and the same in windows to create a folder
- to create a file in linux: touch fileName.txt whereas in windows type nul > filename.txt
- again remeber this type nul > your_file.txt
- the url for the above: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30011267/windows-equivalent-of-touch-i-e-the-node-js-way-to-create-an-index-html

5. ll -a : to list all the contents with details

- cp -r .git unixcommands

![copying(cp)in case of a hidden folder copy to another folder](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/16.PNG)

- You can, of course, rename the file while copying. Copy the hidden file again,renaming it in the process:
- from hidden to hidden status: cp -r .git testingFolder/.gitRenamed
- from hidden to non-hidden status:  cp -r .git testingFolder/gitRenamed

# Buffer Overflow Attack - Computerphile

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S0aBV-Waeo&feature=youtu.be
- A Buffer Overflow exploit is a situation where we're using a low level function like C to write a string into a piece of memory which is only of certain length.
- but we're trying to write on that memory, something, which is longer than that; and it then overwites the later memory address which in turn can cause a lot of problems.
- 1st thing on talk, roughly what happens to memory when a program is run. in this regards, we're talking about c program in linux but this can be extended to work on many different languages and operating systems
- when a program is run on an OS, at that time we're making to run that program with some shell and we type in the command like theFileName.extensionOfTheProgrq,
- now, at that time, the OS would effectively call, as a function, the main method of your code
- but your actual process, your executable, will be held in a memory in a very specific way, and it's consistent between different processes

![big block of Ram](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/31.PNG)

- we have a big block of Ram, we dont know how big our RAM is because it is varied, but we use called Virtual Memory Translation to say that, everything in here, this is 0x000000... which i sthe bottom of the memory
- and up at the top we have 0xfffff which is the equivalent of 11111memory addresses, all the way upto 32 or 64bit and it starts from 0.

![memory addressses](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/32.PNG)

###### 32bit ram

- https://techterms.com/help/difference_between_32-bit_and_64-bit_systems#:~:text=One%20bit%20in%20the%20register,temporary%20values%20besides%20memory%20addresses.
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21197010/how-long-is-a-memory-address-typically-in-bits
- https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs101/bits-bytes.html

- 32-bit and 64-bit are commonly used to describe processor architecture or design. 
- A 32-bit processor includes a 32-bit register, which can store 2^32 or 4,294,967,296 values. 
- A 64-bit processor includes a 64-bit register, which can store 2^64 or 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 values. 
- Therefore, a 64-bit register is not twice as large as a 32-bit register, but is 4,294,967,296 times larger. 
- That's a big difference, but how does it affect computing performance?
- The CPU register stores memory addresses, which is how the processor accesses data from RAM. 
- The processor uses 32 bits to store an address.
- With 32 bits, you can store 2^32 distinct numbers, ranging from 0 to 2^32 - 1. 
- "Byte addressing" means that each byte in memory is individually addressable, i.e. there is an address x which points to that specific byte. 
- Since there are 2^32 different numbers you can put into a 32-bit address, we can address up to 2^32 bytes, or 4 GB.
- Conclusion: 32 bits means 2^32 memory address is accessible in one cycle. Each memory address points to 1 byte of data. So 2^32 memory address is 4Gigabytes of data
- Similarly 64bits CPU can address 2^64=(16 exabytes)18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes, or 17,179,869,184 gigabytes (16 exabytes) of memory.
![memory addressses](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/33.PNG)

#### Buffer Overflow Attack - Computerphile contd...

- now, when we use the ram memory, there are already certain areas of this memory that are always allocated to certain things
- so up at the top, we have the kernel things, so; this will be commandline parameters that we can pass to our program and environment variables and so on

![kernel intro](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/34.PNG)

- down at the bottom, we have something called text. That's the actual code of our program. The machine instructions that we compiled, get loaded in there. 

![text](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/35.PNG)

- And that's the read only, because we dont want to be messing about that, down there

![data](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/36.PNG)

- just on the top of text, we have data. So in data, uninitialised and initialised variables get held here in data.
- And then we have the heap. Now, the heap may have been mentioned from time to time, it's where you allocate large things in your memory.

![heap](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/37.PNG)

- Big area of memory that you can allocate huge chunks on to do various things and what you do with that is, of course, upto your programme.
- And then up there, we have something which is perhaps the most important bit, in someway anyway, is the stack.

![stack](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/38.PNG)

- Now, the stack holds the local variables of your functions and when you call a new function like, like printf followed by some parameters; that gets put on the end of the stack.
- So, the heap grows in the upward direction towards the stack,as you add memory in ways of allocating large things, and the stack grows towards the heap

![stack&heapGROWTH](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/39.PNG)

#### stack

- let's focus on stack, because that's where a lot of these buffer overflows happen.
- we can also have overflows in other areas, but stack is the important part

![stack, high and low memory addresses](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/40.PNG)

- the stack grows downwards from high memory addresses to low memory addresses. So, when we add something onto the end of the stack it gets put on and move towards low memory address point

![stack, high to low memory addresses](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/41.PNG)

- some very acurate and fine details about stack is given below
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/stack_algorithm.htm
- there's a very minimal difference between arraylist and linkedlist
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/differences-between-arraylist-and-linkedlist-in-java#:~:text=LinkedList%20uses%20Doubly%20Linked%20List%20to%20store%20its%20elements.&text=ArrayList%20is%20slow%20as%20array,not%20much%20bit%20shifting%20required.&text=ArrayList%20implements%20only%20List.

#### stack from the video contd..

- let's consider that we have some programme that's calling a function.
- A function is some area code that does something and then returns back to where it was before.

![using the calling function](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/42.PNG)

- when the calling function wants to make sure of something, it adds its parameters that it's passing onto the stack 

![using the calling function](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/43.PNG)

- so the parameter A and B are added onto the stack in reverse order

![parameter A and B are added onto the stack in reverse order](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/44.PNG)

![parameter are added onto the stack in reverse order](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/45.PNG)

- And then the assembler code for this function will make something called a "call" and that would jump to somehwere else in the memory and work with these two things and it's the nature of this stack that causes us to have problems

![assembly language](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/46.PNG)

- let's look into some code and find out how it works

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
	char buffer[500];
	strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);
	return 0;
}

```

- the above C code allocates some memory on the stack and then copies a string into it from the command line

- so in the C programme, we got the main function that takes the number of parameters given and a pointer to those variables that you've got 

- pointers below
https://www.javatpoint.com/c-pointers#:~:text=The%20pointer%20in%20C%20language,function%2C%20or%20any%20other%20pointer.&text=int*%20p%20%3D%20%26n%3B%20%2F%2F,variable%20n%20of%20type%20integer.
- %d decimal output, %x hexadecimal output
- pointer program, a general one , which is easier to understand is below
![pointer programme example](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/47.PNG)

#### stack, c program, pointer, video dude contd..

- and they'll be help in the kernel area of our memory
- we have allocated a buffer that's 500 character long and then we call a function called strcpy, which will copy our commandline parameter into argv into our buffer

![buffer,strcpy](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/48.PNG)


- our function puts on a return address which is replacing the code we need to go back to once we've done strcpy

![return](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/49.PNG)

- so that's how main knows where to go after it's finished
- And then we have put on a reference to the base pointer in our previous function. It's not important to this video.

![basePointer](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/50.PNG)
- this is just going to be our EBP base pointer

- the below is our allocated space for buffer and it's 500 long

![our allocated space for buffer](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/51.PNG)

![our allocated space for buffer](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/52.PNG)

- if we write into it something that's longer than 500, we're going to to straight past the buffer,over this(EBP base pointer), and crucially over our return variable

- And that's where we point back to something we shouldn't be doing (Kali Linux Distribution)

- we have a small function in the c program, that does our copy from the commandline. So compilation, done, and now running it with "Hello"
- this will copy "hello" into this buffer and then simply return, so nothing happens.

- putting the commandline parameter Hello while running the program
![putting the commandline parameter Hello while running the program](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/53.PNG)

###### basic programme
- we can consider another program that can copy "Hello" into the buffer and process it; example make it all upper-case.
- so we can get a function which makes it all, uppercase
- so I can copy hello off, and then can change this newcopy to be all uppercase, and then you output it in the screen
- and that doesn't even have to be main and it could be just any function

##### GDB:- basic Linux commandline debugger
- GDB not adviseable unless you really like seeing lots of Assembly and doing really low-level Linux things
- so we go to the location and do GDB, this initiates GDB
- type in 
```
list
```
- and it shows the code for our function. So we can see that it just compiled our function
- done from our computer
![done from our computer](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/89.PNG)


![programme from gdb](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/54.PNG)
- now, it knows this because the compiler included this information along with the executable
- we can also show the machine code for this so we can say "disas main"(in the gdb) disassemble main and we can see the code for main
![disas main](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/55.PNG)
- the above snap shows the actual cpu instructions that will be run
- check Steve Bagley's video for Assembly
- however, a couple of very important things are:
- the line here sub of 0x1f4 from %esp, that's allocating 500 for the buffer
![0x1f4 from %esp](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/56.PNG)
- we're at the begining of the stack and from there we go 500 in the below direction and that's where our buffer goes
###### starting from stack and going 500 units to buffer
![starting from stack and going 500 units to buffer](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/57.PNG)
- so the buffer sitting to the left of the image but is lower on memory than the rest of our variables

- now, we can run this program from GDB and if it crashes then we can look at the registers and find out what's happened
- we start like this, run Hello , so GDB starts the program and says Hello and it exited normally
![GDB starts the program and says Hello](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/58.PNG)
- now, we can pass something a little bit longer than Hello
- If we pass something that's over 500, then this buffer will go over this base pointer and this return value, and break the code
![method to go over the EDB and break the code](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/59.PNG)
- It should just crash it. Python, for example, can produce strings based on simple scripts on the command line
- we say, run and then pass it with Python script of print....41(that's the "a" character), let's say 506 times
- python script to print the "a" character, 506 times
![python script to print the "a" character, 506 times](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/60.PNG)
- just a little bit more than 500 so that it is going to cause somewhat of a problem but not a catastrophe and then we run that, so it has received a segmentation fault
![segmentation fault](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/61.PNG)

- now the segmentation fault is something, what a Cpu will send back to you when you're trying to access something in memory you shouldn't be doing.
###### stack situation at threshold which is 500
![stack situation at threshold which is 500](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/62.PNG)
###### stack situation at crossover of the threshold which is 500 and reaching 506
![stack situation](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/63.PNG)
- Again the segmentation fault is something, what a Cpu will send back to you when you're trying to access something in memory you shouldn't be doing.
- But that's not what has actually happened because we overwrote somewhere we shouldn't, what happening is that the return address was half over written with these 41s
###### stack situation where return address was half overwritten by 41s as shown in the photo
![stack situation where return address was half overwritten by 41s as shown in the photo](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/64.PNG)
- so is doesn't know what it is
- so there's nothing in memory at 0xb7004141, and if there is, it doesn't belong to this process. It's not allowed, so it gets segmentation fault
- so if we now, change that to 508("a" character number of times), we're going 2 bytes further along, which means we're now overwriting the entirety of our return address.
!["a" character number of times is 508](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/65.PNG)
!["a" character number of times is 508 and overwriting the entirety of our return address](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/66.PNG)
- so we're overwriting the "return address" with 41s. Now, if there were some virus code at 414141, that's a big problem. 
- so we run this and now can see that the return address is now 0x414141
![return address is now 0x414141](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/67.PNG)
###### the register situation
![the register situation](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/68.PNG)
- we can now see that in the register, the instruction/construction pointer is now trying to point ot 0x414141 which means that it has read this return value and tried to return to that place in the code and run it, and ofcourse it can'take

#### code broken, now what do we do

- what we need to do is change this return value to somewhere where we've got some payload we're trying to give- we're trying to produce
- let's quit the debugger and checkout the payload
- this payload is a simple, very short programme in Assembler, that puts some variables on the stack and then executes the system call to tell it to run a shell- to run a new command line
- our shell code, would depend on linux OS and not on the CPU type 
![our shell code](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/69.PNG)
- this is just a string of different commands. Crucially, this xcd\x80 is throwing a system interrupt, which means that it's going to run the system call.

- what this will actually do is run something called ZSH, which is an old shell that doesn't have a lot of protections involved

###### contd....
- let's go back to our debugger , gdb, and we're gonna run again but this time, a slightly more malicious code
- \x41 * 508 and then putting our shell code

- to craft an exploit from this, what we need to do is remember the fact that strcopy is going to copy into our buffer.
- so we're gonna start at the beginning of buffer which is the point not facing base pointer
![start at the beginning of buffer](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/77.PNG)

- so we're gonna start at the beginning of the buffer. we want to overwrite the memory of the return address with somewhere pointing to our malicius code
- now, we can't necessarily know for sure where our malicious code might be stored elsewhere on the disk, so we dont worry about that or memory
- so we want to put it in this buffer. so we're going to put some maliciouscode in here and then we're going to have a return address that points back into it
- Memory moves around slightly. When you run these programmes, things change slightly, environment variables are added or removed, things move around
- so, we want to try and hedge our bets and get the rough area that this will go in

###### machine instruction for "just move to the next one"
![No-Op sled](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/80.PNG)
- anywhere we land in that No-Op is going to tick along to out malicious code
- so we have a load of \x90s , then we have our shell code. That's our malicious payload that runs our shell
- return address, right in the right place, that points back right smack in the middle of these \x90s
![No-Op sled](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/81.PNG)
- and what that means is, even if it moves a bit, it'll still work
- just like having a slope almost

- Alternatively, you can write the C program through the Terminal in gedit as follows:

$ gedit sampleProgram.c
- compiled
$ gcc [programName].c -o programName
- run
$ ./programName

# shell

- kernel is the nucleus of a computer
- kernel makes the communication happen between the software and hardware, possible
- kernel is the innermost part of the OS, and the shell is a part of outermost part of the OS
- a shell in Linux OS, takes input from user in the form of commands, processes them and gives the output
- shell is an interface through which a user works on the program's commands and scripts

![shell](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/91.PNG)

-  a shell is accessed by a terminal which runs it
- when you're in the terminal the shell issues a command prompt which is usually the dollar sign, where in you can type your input, which is then executed when you enter the enter key.
-  So if we press PWD then the output is displayed in the terminal
- the shell wraps around the delicate interior of an OS, protecting it from accidental damage, hence the name shell
- there are two main shells in Linux, the first one in Bourne shell
- the prompt for the Bourne shell is the dollar sign and it's derivative is the POSIX shell, also known as sh. Korn shell is also known as sh and Bourne Again Shell also known as bash which is the most popular of them all
- The second one, which is another important shell in Linux is "The C" shell. The prompts for this shell is "%" and it's sub-categories are "C shell" aka csh, "Tops C SHell" aka tcsh

#### what is shell scripting and it's uses

- writing a series of command for the shell to execute is called shell scripting
- it can combine the lengthy and repetative sequence of commands into a single and simple script which can be stored and executed anytime
- this reduces the efforts required by the end-user

#### steps to create a shell-script

1. create a file with vi editor or any other text eidtor
2. name the script file with extension .sh
3. start the script with 
```
#! /bin/sh
```
4. write some code
5. save the script file as filename.sh
6. for executing the script type
```
bash filename.sh
```
- here  #! called shebang which directs the script to the interpretator location
- creating a small script with VI editor"
```
vi samplescript.sh
```
- pressing "I" key in the keyboard, we enter the Insert mode in the editor
- enter the command
```
#!/bin/sh
ls
```
- esc to get out of insert mode
- :wq and enter
- running the command and checking the output

#### adding shell comments

- #comment

#### shell variables

![shell variables](https://github.com/anindameister/security/blob/master/snaps/93.PNG)
- read command
